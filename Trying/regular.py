in the ratio of 50:50. Maximum CIE marks are 50. SEE should be awarded by the co urse teacher every semester (III to VIII) 
for 50 marks and marks scored by the student are scaled down to 50 in the VIII semester.  
4. The students who take a course on Physical Education and Yoga, he/she has to take up the semester end practical examination 
prescribed for 100 marks. The students who opt for NSS course have to submit report and attend viva -voce examination. The 
marks of the report shall be 50 marks and for the presentation/viva -voce 50 marks. SEE scale down to 50 marks.

students shall attend classes for the course during the semester and complete all formalities of attendance and CIE. In case,  any 
student fails to secure the minimum 40% of the prescribed CIE marks, he/she shall be deemed to have secured ‘F’ grade. In such 
a case, the student has to fulfill the requirements during subsequent semester/s to appear for CIE. Incase student fails to r egister 
for the said course/ falls short of attendance, he/she will repeat the course whenever it is offered next. Additional Mathema tics I 
shall have CIE component only and no SEE component. This Course shall not be considered for vertical progression, but 
comple tion of the course shall be mandatory for the award of the degree.   
Lateral Entry Students:  
AICTE Activity Points to be earned by students admitted to BE program (For more details refer to Chapter 6, AICTE, 
Activity Point Program, Model Internship Guidel ines):  
Every regular student, who is admitted to the 4 -year degree program, is required to earn 100 activity points in addition to the total 
credits earned for the program. Students entering 4 years degree program through lateral entry are required to earn  75 activity 
points in addition to the total credits earned for the program. The activity points earned by the student shall be reflected on the 
students VIII semester grade card. The activities to earn the points can be spread over the duration of the cou rse. However, 
minimum prescribed duration should be fulfilled. Activity points (non -credit) have no effect on SGPA/CGPA and shall not be 
considered for vertical progression. Incase student fail to earn the prescribed activity points; VIII semester grade ca rd shall be 
issued only after earning the required activity Points. Students shall be eligible for the award of degree only after the rel ease of the 
VIII semester grade card.

Innovation/ Societal/Entrepreneu rship -based Internship : At the end of the fourth Semester a four -week Summer Internship shall be 
carried out, based on industrial/Govt./NGO/MSME/Rural Internship/Innovation/Entrepreneurship. All the students admitted shall  have 
to undergo a mandatory inter nship of 04 weeks during the vacation of the IV semester. A Viva -Voce examination shall be conducted 
during the VI semester and the prescribed credit shall be included in the VI semester. Internship shall be considered as a he ad of passing 
and shall be con sidered for the award of degree. Those, who do not take up/complete the internship shall be declared fail and shall have
